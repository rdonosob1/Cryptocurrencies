# Cryptocurrencies
## Overview
Unlike supervised learning, in this current situation, we will use unsupervised machine learning models in order to discover patterns or groups in data in regards of investments with cryptocurrencies, since we know the input (data), but the output is unkown. 
 
## Project Objective
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. However, teh company is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, the aim of this report consists in using unservised machine learning in order to show what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

The data previpusly obtained is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Since there is no known output for what the company is looking for, the better method for this scenario is to use unsupervised learning. 
Additionally, to group the cryptocurrencies, we have decided on a clustering algorithm. 
Finally, weâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board.
